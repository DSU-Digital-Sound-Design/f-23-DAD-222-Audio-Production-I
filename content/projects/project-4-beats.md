title: "Project 4: Beatmaking"
---

Create a **16-32 measure** musical composition using samples from several different sources. Each of these catagories will represent one track and instance of Sitalia. This project can be a re-imaginging of your loop project but with these new samples. 

The project should contain at least four tracks of the following types. Each of the four tracks need to contain only MIDI information used to trigger Sitalia. Download the samples with a Youtube Downloader like [Youtube Downloader - Online Youtube Video Downloader | YT1s.com](https://yt1s.com/en629). After downloading the track, select and render the portion you wish to use and then open it in Sitalia. 

## Track Catagories 

1. **Drum Loop** - A drum loop from a classic breakbeat like "Amen, Brother" by The Winstons. This provides a rhythmic foundation. 
   1. Ex: [Drum Breaks (Most Used) Music Samples, Covers and Remixes | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/song-tag/Drum%20Breaks%20%28Most%20Used%29/) 
2. **Chordal Hits** - Find a sample or loop that is of a chordal instrument. You can search Who Sampled by instrument. Ex: [Piano Music Samples, Covers and Remixes | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/song-tag/Piano/) or [Johannes Brahms - Samples, Covers and Remixes | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/Johannes-Brahms/)
3. **Vocal Sample** - Ex: 
   1. [Mariah Carey - Samples, Covers and Remixes | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/Mariah-Carey/) 
   2. [Think (About It) by Lyn Collins - Samples, Covers and Remixes | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/Lyn-Collins/Think-(About-It)/)
   3. [Burial's 'Archangel' sample of Ray J's 'One Wish' | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/2631/Burial-Archangel-Ray-J-One-Wish/)
4. **Found Sounds** - From [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) look for short sounds like vinyl noise, field recordings, etc add texture and ear candy.

Use the production techniques we've learned so far in class to make your project sound good. This includes EQ, compression, reverb, and delay.

> In addition to your four MIDI tracks, you can use `one` audio loop in your project if you wish. 

Submit to D2L:

- a compressed folder containing your project files (including audio)
- a rendered audio file of your master mix.
