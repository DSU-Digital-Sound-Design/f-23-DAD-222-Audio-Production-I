Download the [multitrack](Audio.zip) files and import them into Reaper.

Let's review the basic filter types:

1. high-pass
2. low-pass
3. band
4. band-pass

The standard parameters of any EQ are:

1. **Frequency** determines the center frequency
2. **Q** determines the bandwidth
3. **Gain** determines the amount of boost or cut.

> Take a minute to identify each of these bands in ReaEQ and find the parameters that allow you to alter the EQ.

## Sweeping Technique - for corrective EQ

**Solo Track:** Choose the specific audio track you want to work on (e.g., piano, guitar, vocals).

**EQ Setup:**

- Open your EQ plugin on the selected track.
- Select a frequency band for analysis.

**Dramatic Boost (for diagnosis):**

- Set a high gain level, typically between +12 to +15 dB.
- Narrow the bandwidth by increasing the Q value.

**Frequency Sweep:**

- Increase the frequency value through the spectrum.
- Listen carefully to the changes in the instrument's sound as you sweep through frequencies.

**Detect Problematic and Ideal Areas:**

- Identify frequencies that sound problematic (e.g., harsh, muddy).
- Note frequencies where the instrument sounds its best.

**Sweep Backward:**

- Decrease the frequency value to sweep back through the spectrum.
- Refine your observations of problematic and ideal areas.

**Make Minimal Adjustments:**

- Reduce gain to a more reasonable level (typically 1 to 3 dB).
- Attenuate problematic frequencies instead of boosting.

**Repeat as Needed:**

- Continue the process for each problematic frequency area identified.

**Regular A/B Testing:**

- Compare the altered sound to the original to ensure improvements.

**Fine-Tune the Mix:**

- Apply this process to other tracks to balance the mix.

## EQ for balance

Reducing masking with equalization involves adjusting the frequency content of different audio tracks in a mix to make them fit together more cohesively and reduce conflicts between them. Here's a step-by-step process for achieving this:

**Listen Actively:**

Start by listening to your entire mix and identify any areas where different instruments or sounds are clashing or masking each other. Masking occurs when two or more sounds occupy the same frequency range, making it hard to distinguish them.

**Solo the Affected Tracks:**

Isolate the tracks that are experiencing masking issues. These are the tracks that need equalization adjustments.

**Identify the Dominant Sound:**

Determine which of the conflicting tracks is the most critical to the mix or carries the main musical element. This will be your reference track.

**Apply High-Pass Filters (if needed):**

If the tracks you're working on contain low-frequency content that isn't essential, consider applying high-pass filters to remove unnecessary low-end information. This can create more space for other tracks.

**Frequency Analysis:**

Use a spectrum analyzer or EQ plugin to visually analyze the frequency content of the tracks. Look for overlapping frequency ranges.

**Select the Reference Track:**

Focus on the reference track and identify the specific frequency ranges where it shines and carries its unique character. Take note of these frequency ranges.

**Identify Masked Areas:**

Listen to the other tracks and pinpoint the frequency ranges where they conflict or mask the reference track. These are the problematic areas.

**Apply EQ to Masked Tracks:**

For each masked track, use the EQ plugin to reduce the volume (attenuate) of the problematic frequency ranges that clash with the reference track. Make subtle adjustments by cutting frequencies, typically 1 to 3 dB, to create more separation.

**Fine-Tune Q Values:**

Adjust the Q value (bandwidth) of your EQ to control the width of your frequency cuts. Narrower bandwidths can be useful for precise notching, while wider bandwidths can have a gentler effect.

**A/B Testing:**

Continuously A/B test the changes you make by bypassing the EQ to ensure you're improving the mix.

**Repeat for Other Masked Tracks:**

Apply the same process to other tracks that are masking the reference track.

**Listen to the Mix as a Whole:**

After equalizing all the masked tracks, listen to the entire mix again to ensure that the masking issues are resolved and that the mix sounds more balanced and clear.
