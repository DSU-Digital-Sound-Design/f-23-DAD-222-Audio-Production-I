## Tools

-  [Timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/eggtimer-countdown/full-screen/), [FX Randomizer](https://www.classtools.net/random-name-picker/41_kAdkRk)

## Setup

- First, add all of the effects on the wheel to your project. They can be on different tracks. Make sure the effects are deactivated or unchecked. 
- We will have seven rounds of varying lengths of time. For each round, add the chosen effect to your project. You'll have until the timer buzzes to play with the effect and hear what they sound like.
- Each time the wheel spins and lands on an effect, activate that effect on your track. 

## Game 

- Round 1: five minutes
- Round 2: four minutes
- Round 3: three minutes
- Round 4: two minutes
- Round 5: one minute
- Round 6: 30 seconds
- Round 7: 15 seconds

## Wrap up and sharing 

- After we finish the timed portion, spend five more minutes working on your project. 
- We'll listen to each of your compositions in class to see what you came up with. What effects did you like the best? The least? Were there effects that you were confused by?
