# Electronic sound production - synthesis

{{% note %}}
We have learned some basics of electronic sound production with our discussion of MIDI editing, sequencing and sampling. Now we'll dive deeper into a very important method of sound production, synthesis.

**Synthesis** refers to any method that generates sound “from the ground up” according to some recipe, or algorithm. For example, to re-create the sound of a trumpet using a synthesis method, you could use software that adds together simple sine waves whose frequencies, amplitudes, and phases match the partials that are present in a trumpet sound. This particular method is referred to as additive synthesis and will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter along with a variety of other synthesis methods.

## Analog Days: Synthesizers in the 1960s and 1970s

- Robert Moog, Donald Buchla, and others
  - analog
  - modular
  - voltage controlled

{{% note %}}

- analog
  - electrical signals in the synths consisted of continuous changes in electrical voltage rather than a discrete series of numbers as in modern digital synthesizers.
- modular
  - the task of generating sound was distributed among separate hardware units called modules.
  - oscillators, filters, and amplifiers were separate modules.
- voltage controlled
  - keyboards, joysticks, and ribbon controllers were used to send control voltages to the modules to change their settings.

Yamaha DX7, an early all-digital, MIDI-compatible keyboard synthesizer (1983). At about $2,000, the DX7 was relatively inexpensive by early 1980s’ standards.

## Basic synthesis model

![](basic-synth-model.png)

{{% note %}}
We can think of these as three separate modules that have different purposes and can be combined to create a sound.

• The oscillator provides a basic waveform (timbre) at a particular frequency (pitch).
• The filter modifies the spectrum (timbre) of the basic waveform.
• The amplifier applies an envelope to the amplitude of the audio (loudness and
articulation).

In our DAWs we perform not actual analogue synthesis, but analogue modeling synthesis.

The v stands for voltage control, which harkens back to when these modules were actually controlled by electrical voltage.

# Pitch and timbre source: the oscillator

## Basic Waveforms

![](basic-waveforms.png)

{{% note %}}
Oscillator - generate a waveform at a particular frequency. They take one cycle of a waveform and repeat it at a rate determined by the MIDI key number.

This is called fixed waveform or wavetable synthesis. Used alone it is the most simple form of synthesis.

## Noise

{{% note %}}
An important source for timbre is noise. It is often used for percussive synthesis. When filtered it can also be used for wind sounds and rising effects in EDM.

## Timbre modification: the filter

![](filter-types.jpg)

[Learning Synths - Fitlers](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/filters/filters-in-the-real-world)

{{% note %}}
We have already covered filters somewhat in our discussions on mixing. Here we called them equalization and they generally had a subtle effect on the sound.

in sound synthesis filters have a much more drastic and noticeable effect.

A very common filter in synthesis is the low pass filter. It creates the typical DJ sweep sound we all know and love..

The **cutoff frequency** of the filter determines where in the spectrum the partials start to be reduced in amplitude.

**Resonance** in a filter boosts the amplitude of the partials at the cutoff frequency. This has a certain timbral effect.

# Loudness modification: the amplifier

{{% note %}}
The third part in our synthesis chain is the amplifier. Instead of just turning the oscillator on and off we shape it with an amplitude envelope.

## Applying articulation with an envelope

![](envelope.png)

[Learning Synths - Envelopes](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/envelopes/change-over-time)

{{% note %}}

In a synthesizer, an envelope generator allows the amplifier both to determine the maximum amplitude of the sound and to shape the amplitude over the course of a note.

ADSR - attack time, decay time, sustain level, release time

- attack - the time it takes for the amplitude to reach its maximum value.
- decay - the time it takes for the amplitude to reach its sustain level.
- sustain - the level of amplitude that the envelope will hold after the decay phase.
  - this last as long as the note is held.
- release - after a note off message - the time it takes for the amplitude to reach its minimum value.
