# Reaper Intro

{{% note %}}

One of the most unique features of Reaper compared to other DAWs, such as Pro Tools, Logic Pro, or Ableton Live, is that everything is customizable, including key commands, menus, toolbars, and mouse behaviors. Reaper has reasonable defaults, so you don't have to worry about customizing everything immediately.

> Tracks can also become folders containing many tracks.

## You Try 

> Find a few random sounds from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) and import them. Notice how the track name changes to match the item name. As you drag in clips notice how the items snap to the grid. If this doesn't happen make sure you have snapping turned on.

# Items

* In Reaper, we refer to audio files as Items or Media Items. 
* These can be copied and pasted and moved to taste. 
* We can also trim the beginning and end of the tracks with our mouse cursor. 
* We can also trim multiple files at once by selecting them all.

---

* Dragging an item to the right will cause it to start looping.
* We can add fade-ins and fade-outs by holding our cursor over the top corner of the items. We can also apply fades to all tracks by selecting them.
* Zoom in and out of items vertically using your mouse wheel. Zoom horizontally using the modifier cmd and your mouse wheel.
* Right-click the items to see a contextual menu with more options for the items.
