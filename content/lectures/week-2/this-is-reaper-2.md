# Audio device settings

Check your audio device settings in the Reaper preferences (cmd +,) `Audio -> Device -> Audio device settings -> Audio Device`. The audio device can change if you plug into audio interfaces or microphones.

# Start a new project

Select `File menu -> New` project or the first button on the toolbar. But nothing happens because we haven't saved the project yet. We can tell Reaper to prompt us so we don't forget. Select `Preferences -> Project -> Prompt` to save on new project. Now, we can save the file. Check both checkboxes below to create a subdirectory for the project and copy all new media into the project.

Now, find your project and notice a folder with the RPP file.

# Project settings

Create a directory to add your media files to called "Audio." Also, set "on import of media to project" to "copy media to project path." Save as the default project settings so you don't have to repeat this. Now, you should be able to add files to your project and have them automatically copied into your media directory.

## Peaks subfolder

To further organize your files, go to Reaper `Preferences -> Media and check "Put new peak files in peaks/ subfolder relative to media.`
