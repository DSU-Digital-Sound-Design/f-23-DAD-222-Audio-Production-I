To undo, click `cmd + z`. Or, if you want to see an entire undo history, access the undo history under `Edit -> Undo History`. You can now see your previous actions and return to an earlier state.

Hold down alt and drag on an item to adjust its content timing without moving the item.

Place your cursor where you want to split and type `s` to split an item. Splitting an item will allow you to deal with the item in smaller chunks or to delete parts you don't want. If you want to undo the splits you made, you can heal the item. Under the item menu, select `Heal splits in items`. Heal is different from glue, which allows you to connect any items. Heal only heals splits that you made within an item.

Notice that if you move one item on top of another, it starts to create a crossfade. You want this to happen so the audio will smoothly fade from one item to the next without clicks. We generally want crossfades between items to be very small.

The same principles work when you have multiple items on different tracks. Duplicate your track twice and select all the items by right-click-dragging.

## Ripple Editing 

You can enable `Ripple editing per track` in the toolbar menu. Ripple editing is a feature that allows you to make changes to your audio or MIDI items while automatically adjusting the positions of subsequent items, to maintain the timing and arrangement of your project. Ripple editing can be handy when editing multiple items in a sequence or removing silences from a dialogue recording.

## Razor Edits

Razor edits, combined with ripple editing mode, can expedite the process of editing dialogue. Right-click-drag the section of audio that you wish to delete. You'll see a razor icon showing that you're in razor editing mode. Press delete to remove your selected audio after making the razor edit selection.
