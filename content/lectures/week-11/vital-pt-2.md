title: "More Vital Synth"
---

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we explored the ADSR envelope in Vital Synth. Today, we're diving deeper into creating more complex sounds by utilizing multiple oscillators and adding effects. We'll explore three unique sound patches and look at how to use effects like chorus, compressor, and flangers.

## Adding More Oscillators for Richness

### What You'll Do

1. Turn on oscillators 2 and 3 in the Vital Synth interface.
2. Listen to how the sound changes when these additional oscillators are activated.

### Key Takeaways

- Additional oscillators function similarly to oscillator 1 but provide layering opportunities for richer sounds.

## Creating Sound Patches

### Patch 1: Ghostly Choir

#### Steps to Create Patch

1. **Set Waveform**: For each oscillator, choose a sine tone. This is the first option under basic shapes.
2. **Detune Oscillators**: Adjust the detune for oscillators 1 and 2 slightly above and below oscillator 1.
3. **Activate Filters**: Turn on the filters in Vital.

#### What to Notice

- Listen to the sound and observe if it matches your expectations.
- Look at the spectrogram. Do you see much change? 
- Note that most of the timbral change may be psychoacoustic and not show up on the meter.

### Patch 2: Chorus Bass

#### Steps to Create Patch

1. **Reset to Initial State**: Make sure you are working on a fresh patch.
2. **Set Waveform**: Choose a sawtooth wave for both oscillators.
3. **Pitch Adjustment**: Set the pitch of the second oscillator to -12 to lower it by an octave.
4. **Routing to Filter**: Route the second oscillator to Filter 1.

### Patch 3: Adding the Sampler

#### Steps to Create Patch

1. **Access Sampler**: Open the sampler in Vital.
2. **Select or Add Sample**: You can use built-in samples or upload your own.
3. **Playback Options**: Use buttons to decide how the sample is played. Options include loop, play then reverse, and play from the previous stop point.
   
#### Practical Uses

- Use textural samples to add grit to your synths.
- Use percussive samples to add a nice click at the beginning of your envelope.

## Additional Parameters to Know

- **Voices Number**: Determines the number of sounds you can play simultaneously.
- **Bend**: Sets the pitch bend range when using a MIDI keyboard.
- **Vel Trk**: Makes Vital respond to velocity messages.
- **Spread**: Adjusts the sound's stereo width.
- **Glide**: Causes one note to slide into the next, based on the glide time setting.

## Exploring Effects

### Chorus

- **What it Does**: A chorus is like a delay but also includes pitch modulation.
  
#### Parameters
  
- **Delay Modulation Frequency**: Time before modulation repeats.
- **Delay 1 and Delay 2**: Control delay time for different chorus voices.

### Multi-Band Compressor

- **What it Does**: Compresses the sound across multiple frequency bands.

### Flanger and Phaser

- **What they Do**: Similar to chorus but modulate filters instead of pitch.
  
#### Points to Remember

- Flanger creates a sound by playing the original sound alongside its slightly delayed duplicate.
- Phaser duplicates the sound, filters it, and plays it back with the original sound.

#### Experimentation

- Adjust settings and listen to how the sound changes.
