## Building out the song

- Copy and paste the 2 bar loop to extend it to 16 or 32 bars. This gives you a basic structure to build on.
- Add variations to every 4th or 8th bar. For example, remove the kick drum on the last bar of every 4 bars. Or add an open hi-hat on the 2nd bar of every 8 bars. 
- Create a **B section** or **chorus** by significantly changing parts of the loop. For example, halve the tempo, remove some percussion elements, add new melodic parts.
- Introduce new drum elements during different sections. Bring in the crash cymbal on the chorus. Add shaker in the verse. Remove the clap for one section.
- Automate parts over time. For example, use volume automation to make the hi-hats fade out over 16 bars. Or pan the snare from left to right over 8 bars.
- Arrange parts to follow common song structures. Have the loop repeat for verse sections then bring in more elements for the chorus. Add breakdowns and builds for transitions. 


## Send Drum Parts to Effects

Set Sitalia to multi-out and start adding effects. 

- Process sections differently using effects. Put a low pass filter on the verse loop. Add delays only to the chorus loop.
- Modulate parts like pitch, distortion, filtering over longer periods of time to evolve the loop.
