# Week 4 (9/11)

## Monday

- Record during class time if you haven't booked time yet.
- Editing
  - Each student must edit their own commercial.
  - More tips for editing in Reaper
    - [Editing](../lectures/week-4/editing/)
  - Eliminate empty space between lines to get the "fast talking" effect of a radio ad.
  - Demonstrate zooming into the waveform to more easily see silences.
  - ripple editing
  - Add fades between edits if they're not automatically there.
  - condense your ad to be 30 seconds long.

## Wednesday

- [Digital Audio](../lectures/week-4/digital-audio-data/)
- More recording in class if necessary
- Reminder about razor editing with ripple mode - very useful for cutting out silence and speeding up dialogue
- Create two folders for your sound effects and music. This way you can have control over the mix of your dialogue, sfx, and music independently.
- Sound Effects + music beds
  - [Finding sound effects](../lectures/week-4/sound-effects/)
  - Listen back to the ads from a few classes ago, what types of sound effects do they use?
  - Examples could be transition impacts or swooshes between character lines. Some scripts will have specific needs for effects that illustrate locations or products, like chirping birds for outdoor settings.
  - Add sound effects to separate tracks
  - make sure your music and dialogue work well together, listen to the examples for how the dialogue is timed to the music
- mixing - background music should be much quieter than dialogue, around -30 dB is a good start.

## Friday

- Listen to the ads in class
- Catch up time for any behind students

- Do this basic music mix - [download](https://mtkdata.cambridgemusictechnology.co.uk/MTK005/cfx_Mathematician.zip)
  - set the levels so that nothing is clipping and everything can be heard easily
  - find the tracks that still can't be heard, what other tracks are masking those?
  - Add an equalizer to the masking track to try to "carve" out a space for the other track to be heard
